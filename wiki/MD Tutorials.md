# Welcome

Glad you wish to learn molecular dynamics (MD). This page is a repository for notebooks that teach you basic and advanced MD issues we run into all the time.

### The basics. ###
* We use an open source MD code called [HOOMD-blue](http://glotzerlab.engin.umich.edu/hoomd-blue/) to run MD simulations. The [HOOMD tutorials](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/joaander/hoomd-examples/blob/master/index.ipynb) are a great way to start learning to do MD. [Installing](http://glotzerlab.engin.umich.edu/hoomd-blue/download.html) and getting started is really easy and fun. Enjoy!

* Assuming you already tried out some basic MD simulations, a few questions to ask about the system you are modelling:

1. How small of a system is too small? How large is too large (Too large to be practical for your purpose)?
2. How long does your system take to reach equilibrium (if it is an equilibrium simulation)?
3. Are there any characteristic state points in your system (like a specific temperature or density where structure changes from solid to liquid or a glass transition temperature)?
